Running:

 * ./run-tests
 	- to run all tests
 * ./run-tests <test-dir>
 	- run all tests in <test-dir>
 * ./run-tests <test-file>
 	- run a single test file

 * The -c option will cause the test suite to continue on failures

Writing tests:

 * The test script looks for executables in the test/ directory that
   have a name that starts with a number.

 * Tests are run in order of their name.

 * In its most basic format, we expect a return code of 0

 * You can add a test.conf to the test directory to define additional behaviour
   The format of this file is:
   <test-name>: <options>

   where options may be one or more of:
   	expected_rc=<rc>	# expect a rc of <rc> instead of 0
   	disabled=1		# disable the test
	needs_root=1		# disable the test if run by a non-root user

   for example, from the testsuite's own test.conf:
   	01-fail: expected_rc=1
	02-root: needs_root=1
	03-skip: disabled=1

   If a test is not listed in test.conf (or there is no test.conf), then
   the default options will be used.

 * Tests are run in a separate working directory, and have the test's build
   directory in the PATH. If you need to create files, use the current working
   directory.

 * Each test should test the smallest amount of functionality as possible. Since
   the tests are run in order, you can assume that all previously-tested
   functionality is working.

 * If you need to do tricky stuff in your test (eg checking for particular
   output), use a shell (or python) script to launch your test and do the
   necessary checking. Remember that only executables that start with numbers
   are included in the test, so you can include utility programs that don't
   start with a number.

Makefiles:

 * .. should be kept very simple.

 * If you add a test that needs to be compiled, add it to the
   Makefile in the same directory, in the 'tests' variable:

	tests += 00-pass 01-fail 02-root 03-skip

   The test will then be compiled using make's implicit rules. If your
   test binary needs more than one .c file, use another target:

	tests += sched_multiple

	sched_multiple: sched_multiple.o sched_multiple_spe_embed.o

 * If you add a directory, add it to tests/Makefile, in the 'dirs' variable"

	dirs = 00-testsuite 01-context 02-gang

   The directory will need (at least) a Makefile, and hopefully some tests :)

 * Your makefile will be included by tests/Makefile.lib, and not executed
   directly.

 * If you need different compiler arguments, set (or better, append to) the
   CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables.

 * If you need to compile with LIBSPE2, the LIBSPE2_CFLAGS and LIBSPE2_LDFLAGS
   variables are provided for convenience. Just do this:

   	CFLAGS	+= $(LIBSPE2_CFLAGS)
	LDFLAGS	+= $(LIBSPE2_LDFLAGS)

   The same applies to libspe1.

General:

 * These tests are intended as a quick, but comprehensive method of verifying
   new changes to spufs and/or libspe. The tests should run quickly and with
   the absolute minimum of fuss.

 * New tests may assume that the following is present:
    - gcc
    - spu-gcc
    - embedspu
    - libspe2 (and the libspe1 compat layer)
    - bash
    - python

 * Under no circumstances should your test require odd things outside the
   testsuite package. The tests will need to be trivial to get working. If you
   need to add dependencies that will be used for multiple tests, add to the
   top-level lib/ directory.

 * Do not make assumptions about the name or directory of your tests - we may
   move tests around as necessary (ie, if we need to add tests that are run
   before it).

 * Having said that, new tests are absolutely welcome :)
